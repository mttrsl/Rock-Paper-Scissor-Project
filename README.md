# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Project
This is a javascript project for the Odin Project where I will create a console based rock paper scissors game.

Users will play 5 rounds against the computer, with the player choosing between rock, paper & scissors, and the computer will make a random choice.

The winner of each round is awarded 1 point, with no points taken for a draw.

After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score is the winner.
